# LinxHoursOfOperation
Hours of operation for various buildings and facilities around NYIT.
Update: Uploaded each file individually. Hopefully these are all the files you'd need. Included are all the .java files, the .xml files related to each .java file, the APP .gradle, and the .xml files that usually go in the values folder (strings, values, style, colors) along with AndroidManifest.xml.
