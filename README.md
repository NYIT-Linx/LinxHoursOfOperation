# LinxHoursOfOperation
Hours of operation for various buildings and facilities around NYIT.

Update: Uploaded each file individually. Hopefully these are all the files you'd need. Included are all the .java files, the .xml files related to each .java file, the layout_list_item.xml which is used by the recyclerview, the APP .gradle, and the .xml files that usually go in the values folder (strings, values, style, colors) along with AndroidManifest.xml.
